# ACFDataExport
WordPress plugin to export ACF field data.

This WordPress plugin is 100% generated by ChatGPT, and it works perfectly.

I'm NOT a developer, so I cannot help you if there are problems.

Installing this plugin will add an "ACF Data Export" sub-menu to the existing "Tools" menu in the left-navigation in WordPress.

From there, simply choose the post type and click the "Download CSV" button.
